# Barebones Sinatra

This is a barebones Sinatra app, nothing in it except "Hello World!"

This is intended to be a starting point for demonstrations in class

Here's how to get it running on gitpod.`


## Gitpod Setup Instructions

1. Sign up for GitPod
2. Fork this repo using the FORK button in the top right [on Github](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/sinatra-example)
3. Open a new tab in your browser (preferably Google Chrome) and visit GitPod with the GitHub URL of your new code project: <https://www.gitpod.io/#https://github.com/YOURUSERNAMEHERE/finstagram> (<mark>Replace YOURUSERNAME with your actual GitHub username</mark>)


### Project Setup (in GitPod)

1. In the Terminal pane/tab, run `gem install bundler`. It should say _"successfully installed bundler-2.0.2"_ (or a greater version number)
2. In that same terminal tab, run `bundle install`. It will output many different lines, each representing a library (piece of code) that our project depends on. Near the end, you should expect to see green text saying _"Bundle complete!"_

### Starting The Project (in GitPod)

1. In a terminal pane/tab, run `bin/serve` to start the server. It should mention _"Listening on port 3001"_ among other things
2. In the top menu, Click _View_, then _Open Ports_. You should see port 3001 with a blue light next to it (to indicate that it is running our project on that port)
3. _Optional:_ If it shows the button _Expose_ for that port, click that button
4. You'll see _Open Preview_ and _Open Browser_, either of which will allow you to open your project in a new window or tab or preview pane. Go ahead and click on your preference (or try both at first to see which one you prefer).

You're now set up and ready to expand on this base code
